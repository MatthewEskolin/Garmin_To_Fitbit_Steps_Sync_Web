# Garmin_To_Fitbit_Steps_Sync_Web


## Development Roadmap
* Need to have confidence in this app to input data into FitBit Correctly so that we don't ever have to login on the fitbit homepage


## Possible Features
* Make it visible to user if activities have been input for the previous days, so we don't forget or create a duplicate entry
* Give us our average steps for the last 7 days here in the APP
* Calcuate Our Average for the Month (using our best 21 days)  - Could we calculate this as [Need to Average x steps over the next x days] 157,500 steps in a month


### 09/13/2020
* Created README.md

### 09/18/2020
* Experimenting with activity time series. It would be helpful to get a snapshop of the last 7 days of steps
* Hide the Connect to FitBit button if we are already connected and don't show the functionality buttons if we are connected. Once we are connected, show the buttons!
